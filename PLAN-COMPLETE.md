## ✅ EVERYTHING YOU NEED

This plan provides:

## 🎓 PHILOSOPHY

This plan follows these principles:

1. **MVP First** - Ship core features, polish later
2. **Commit Often** - Multiple commits per day prevents disasters
3. **Test Locally** - Before pushing to Railway
4. **Communicate** - Daily standups prevent surprises
5. **Focus** - No chat system, no scope creep (Week 3 freezes new features)
6. **Quality** - Edge cases matter
7. **Document** - As you go, not at the end
8. **Deploy Frequently** - Weekly deployments = confidence
